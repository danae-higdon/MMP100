	<h1>I need attention</h1>
	<p>Here are my things</p>
	<p>I do the arts stuff</p>
	<p>I like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lq2ocikbm2w">kiwi bryd</a> <img src="kiwibryd.jpeg">
	<p> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCQgL0I5DGw">ashley Zombie</a> <img src="ashelyZombie.jpeg">
	<p>It was hard to find actual pictures of them but these are close enough</p>
	<p>note: *I did not draw thses. they are self-portraits of the artist*</p>
	<p> As I mentioned before I NEED attention. And so heres a piece of me. i am an artist curaintly taking a life-drawing class where I stare at live nude models which means I stare at boobs and genetals for 2 hours straight. But none the less i still enjoy it. I attend BMCC in NYC and I plan to transfer to New School. Yes there is a collage called New School. I can sew as well i just started about 2 years ago and I'm pretty good at it. I'm also into animation, i havent animationed anything yet but im getting there. I also want to get into sculpting and pottery but i don't know when I'm going to get around to doing in    </p>
	
	<p>I'ma bit of a freak in disguise. i like the look of steampunk. Steampunk is victorian couture and industrial design put together</p> <img src="steampunk couture.jpeg">
